Dr. Graeme J. Kennedy is an associate professor in the Guggenheim School of 
Aerospace Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology where he 
leads his research team. His research involves the development and application 
of numerical optimization techniques to structural and multidisciplinary design 
problems, with a primary focus on the analysis and design of fixed-wing 
aircraft. Before joining the faculty, Dr. Kennedy was a postdoctoral research 
fellow at the University of Michigan in the Department of Aerospace 
Engineering. Dr. Kennedy received his PhD from the University of 
Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS) in 2012.

Sean Engelstad is a first year M.S. student in Aerospace Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he 
received his B.S. in AE as well.  Sean has interned at the Aerospace Corporation the past two summers, working on 
design curves for unvented sandwich structures, a methodology for the treatment of pressure transients in space systems,
and machine learning for valve failures in fluid systems.  As a part of the SMDO group, Sean is working on adding 
mesh sensivitity to the SMDO team's structural optimization software, using Engineering Sketch Pad, ESP/CAPs.  
With mesh sensivities available, optimized solutions can be parameterized as a function of global or local mesh parameters
easily.
