Dr. Graeme J. Kennedy is an associate professor in the Guggenheim School of 
Aerospace Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology where he 
leads his research team. His research involves the development and application 
of numerical optimization techniques to structural and multidisciplinary design 
problems, with a primary focus on the analysis and design of fixed-wing 
aircraft. Before joining the faculty, Dr. Kennedy was a postdoctoral research 
fellow at the University of Michigan in the Department of Aerospace 
Engineering. Dr. Kennedy received his PhD from the University of 
Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS) in 2012.
